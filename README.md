## Welcome to Computer Vision Visualization System(CVVS) 

Hi! Welcome to a visualization system for research in the field of computer vision. This system can be used for classic vision tasks such as object segmentation, edge detection, and target detection. It can also help researchers generate paper images. If you are          interested, you can join     **[YoucanXv](https://github.com/FlyingCan "Dlut student")**     to complete the follow-up software development.   
Let's get started with the system!
